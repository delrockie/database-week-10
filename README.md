### Difficulties Encountered
One difficulty I encountered with the Netflix Shows dataset was dealing with inconsistent data formats in the `duration` column. The `duration` values for movies were stored as strings with varying formats (e.g., "90 min", "1h 30min"), which required parsing and standardizing before performing any meaningful analysis. Additionally, some entries had missing or incomplete data, necessitating data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.

### Interesting Observation
An interesting observation about the Netflix Shows dataset is the significant variation in genre popularity across different regions. For instance, while certain genres like "Drama" and "Comedy" are universally popular, niche genres such as "Anime" and "Documentary" show varying levels of popularity depending on the region. This insight highlights the diverse content preferences of Netflix users around the world and can inform targeted content recommendations and regional content production strategies.
